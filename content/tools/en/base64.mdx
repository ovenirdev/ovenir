# Base64 Encoder & Decoder

Encode text to Base64 or decode Base64 to text — instantly, privately, in your browser.

## What is Base64?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data as ASCII characters. It's commonly used to:

- Embed images in HTML/CSS (data URIs)
- Encode attachments in emails (MIME)
- Store binary data in JSON or XML
- Transmit data over text-only protocols

## How to use

1. **Select mode**: Choose "Encode" or "Decode"
2. **Paste your input**: Enter text (for encoding) or Base64 string (for decoding)
3. **Get instant result**: Output appears immediately — no server needed

## Examples

### Encode text to Base64

**Input:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**Output:**
```
SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
```

### Decode Base64 to text

**Input:**
```
SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Unicode support (UTF-8)

OVENIR handles Unicode correctly, including accented characters, emojis, and CJK scripts.

**Input (Japanese):**
```
こんにちは
```

**Output:**
```
44GT44KT44Gr44Gh44Gv
```

- ✅ **Open source** — [View the code](https://github.com/ovenirdev/ovenir)

## Technical details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Encoding | Standard Base64 (RFC 4648) |
| Character set | A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, / |
| Padding | = (standard) |
| Unicode handling | UTF-8 encoding before Base64 |

## Common use cases

- **Web developers**: Embed images as data URIs
- **API developers**: Encode binary payloads for JSON APIs
- **DevOps**: Decode secrets from Kubernetes configs
- **Email troubleshooting**: Decode MIME attachments

## Limitations

- Large files (>10MB) may slow down your browser
- This tool uses standard Base64, not URL-safe Base64 (use URL Encode for that)

## FAQ

### Is my data safe?

Yes. Everything runs in your browser. We never see your data.

### Does it work offline?

Yes. After the first visit, you can use OVENIR without internet.

### Why does my Base64 look different from other tools?

If you're encoding non-ASCII text (like emojis or Japanese), some tools handle Unicode differently. OVENIR uses UTF-8 encoding before Base64, which is the standard approach.

### What's the maximum input size?

There's no hard limit, but your browser may slow down with very large inputs (>10MB).
